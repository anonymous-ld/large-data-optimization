## ✨ What’s inside?
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **publisher_profile.xml** | 🛰️ QoS settings for a **DataWriter** tuned for high-rate wireless links (large payloads, lossy Wi-Fi). |
| **subscriber_profile.xml** | 📡 Complementary **DataReader** profile guaranteeing in-order, loss-free delivery. |

> **Note** The profiles are distilled from our INFOCOM 2025 study on ROS 2 wireless optimization—see the *About the research* section below for a quick summary.

## 📝 About the research
Our forthcoming paper (accepted to IEEE INFOCOM 2025) investigates why ROS 2’s default DDS parameters under-perform over 802.11ac networks and proposes a lightweight remedy that:

1. **Prevents IP fragmentation** by capping UDP payloads to 1472 bytes.  
2. **Decouples control traffic** from data to avoid bursty retransmissions.  
3. **Bounds writer history** so a reconnect doesn’t unleash a flood of stale samples.  
4. **Maintains end-to-end reliability** without touching core Fast DDS code.  

In 50 Mbps Wi-Fi tests with 4 AMRs streaming 1 MB images, the tuned profiles **cut average latency by 41 %** and **reduced jitter by 34 %** while preserving 100 % delivery ratio.

A full methodological breakdown—experimental setup, analytical model, and ablation studies—appears in the paper’s §IV (Methods) and §V (Results).

## ⚡ Quick Start
```bash
# 0. Environment
#    • Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble
#    • Fast DDS ≥ 2.6.9     (rmw_fastrtps_default)

# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/ros2-wireless-dds.git
cd ros2-wireless-dds

# 2. Export the profile (publisher side)
export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=$(pwd)/publisher_profile.xml
#    Do the same on the subscriber side with subscriber_profile.xml

# 3. Run a demo
ros2 run image_tools cam2image    # publisher
ros2 run image_tools showimage    # subscriber
